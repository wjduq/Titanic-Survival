# TitanicSurvival

In 1912, the Titanic attempted to sail across the Atlantic Ocean from England to the New York. It was hailed as a wonder of engineering and was thought to be unsinkable. Before it could reach New York, it struck an iceberg, and thousands of people died. It remains one of the most infamous sinkingâ€™s of all time, a sinking in which many people perished. The data being used in this study was gathered from the manifest of the Titanic, and other contemporaneous records. I will build a model that will predict which factors increase and decrease the odds of a passenger surviving.
